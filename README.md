# fifo-
Synchronous  fifo  verification using system verilog 
In this repo synchronous fifo is being done alongwith the Testbench having the following components:::
<br />Generator: 	Generates different input stimulus to be driven to DUT 
<br />Interface :	Contains design signals that can be driven or monitored
<br />Driver :	Drives the generated stimulus to the design
<br />Monitor :	Monitor the design input-output ports to capture design activity
<br />Scoreboard : 	Checks output from the design with expected behavior
<br />Environment :	Contains all the verification components mentioned above
<br />Test 	: Contains the environment that can be tweaked with different configuration settings
